## What is Concurrent React? {/*what-is-concurrent-react*/}

* Concurrency
  * != feature, per se
  * concurrent rendering
    * == powerful new tool
  * == NEW behind-the-scenes mechanism /
    * enables
      * 👀React can prepare MULTIPLE versions of your UI | SAME time👀
  * == implementation detail /
    * -> 
      * unlocks features
      * update React's core rendering model 
    * sophisticated techniques
      * _Example:_ priority queues & multiple buffering
      * / NOT seen | our public APIs
        * Reason: 🧠try to hide implementation details -- from -- developers 🧠 
        * if you are React developer -> 
          * focus on *what* you want the UX to look like
            * -> React developers NOT need how concurrency works under the hood 
          * React handles *how* to deliver that UX 
  * -> 
    * 👀rendering can be interrupted or abandoned 👀/
      * vs synchronous rendering 
        * interruptible / UNTIL user can see the result | screen
      * UI still consistent
        * Reason: 🧠once the entire tree has been evaluated (== | end) -> perform DOM mutations 🧠
      * -> NEW screens | background can be prepared / NO blocking the main thread
        * == fluid user experience
          * _Example:_ ALTHOUGH React is | middle of a large rendering task, UI -- can respond immediately to -- user input 
    * 👀reusable state 👀
      * uses
        * currently
          * remove UI's sections & add them back later -- reusing the -- previous state
          * user tabs away | screen & back / React -- restore the -- previous screen | SAME state before
        * | new React releases
          * `<Offscreen>` == new component / implements this pattern
  * uses
    * | MOST of React NEW features
      * _Example:_ Suspense, transitions, streaming server rendering

## Gradually Adopting Concurrent Features {/*gradually-adopting-concurrent-features*/}

* concurrent rendering
  * ⚠️== breaking change ⚠️
    * Reason: 🧠concurrent rendering is interruptible -> components behave slightly different 🧠
  * testing done
    * upgrade thousands of components -- to -- React 18 / 
      * lessons learnt
        * nearly ALL existing components / NO required changes
        * SOME of them -- may require -- SOME additional migration effort  
  * **ONLY enabled | parts of your app / use NEW features**

* adopt concurrent features gradually
  * goal
    * get your application running | React 18 / NO breaking changes  
  * [`<StrictMode>`](/reference/react/StrictMode)
    * help surface concurrency-related bugs | development
      * Reason: 🧠log extra warnings & double-invoke functions🧠
      * NOT catch every possible mistakes
    * NOT affect production behavior

* once you upgrade to React 18 -> you can start using concurrent features

* future releases idea about concurrency
  * 💡-- via -- concurrent-enabled library or framework 💡
    * != -- interact directly with -- concurrent APIs
    * _Example:_ if you want to navigate to a new screen 
      * you need to invoke `startTransition` -- will be replaced by -- router libraries / automatically wrap navigations in startTransition

## Suspense in Data Frameworks {/*suspense-in-data-frameworks*/}

* [Suspense](/src/content/reference/react/Suspense.md)
  * React v18+
  * uses
    * fetch
      * data | opinionated frameworks (_Example:_ Relay, Next.js, Hydrogen, or Remix) 
      * ad hoc data
        * NOT recommended
    * code splitting | client -- via -- `React.lazy` 
  * possible future ideas
    * expose additional primitives / easier to access your data -- via -- Suspense
      * 👀EVEN WITHOUT using opinionated framework 👀
    * SAME declarative Suspense fallback -- can handle -- ANY asynchronous operation (_Example:_ loading code, data, images, etc) 
  * recommendations
    * 👀integrate | your application’s architecture 👀
      * _Example:_ your router, your data layer, and your server rendering environment

## Server Components STILL in Development {/*server-components-is-still-in-development*/}

* [**Server Components**](/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components)
  * ⚠️NOT -- inherently coupled to -- Concurrent React ⚠️
    * BUT designed -- to work best with -- concurrent features 
  * == upcoming feature / 
    * allows developers
      * build apps / span the server and client
        * == interactivity of client-side apps + traditional server rendering
  * STILL experimental
    * expectations -- initial version v18.x --
    * meantime -- via -- frameworks (_Example:_ Next.js, Hydrogen, and Remix)
      * Reason: 🧠broad adoption 🧠

## What's New in React 18 {/*whats-new-in-react-18*/}

### New Feature: Automatic Batching {/*new-feature-automatic-batching*/}

* TODO:
Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Without automatic batching, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default. With automatic batching, these updates will be batched automatically:


```js
// Before: only React events were batched.
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setFlag(f => !f);
  // React will render twice, once for each state update (no batching)
}, 1000);

// After: updates inside of timeouts, promises,
// native event handlers or any other event are batched.
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setFlag(f => !f);
  // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)
}, 1000);
```

For more info, see this post for [Automatic batching for fewer renders in React 18](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/21).

### New Feature: Transitions {/*new-feature-transitions*/}

A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.

* **Urgent updates** reflect direct interaction, like typing, clicking, pressing, and so on.
* **Transition updates** transition the UI from one view to another.

Urgent updates like typing, clicking, or pressing, need immediate response to match our intuitions about how physical objects behave. Otherwise they feel "wrong". However, transitions are different because the user doesn’t expect to see every intermediate value on screen.

For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done rendering, you only care to see the latest results.

Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in both an urgent update and a non-urgent one. You can use startTransition API inside an input event to inform React which updates are urgent and which are "transitions":


```js
import { startTransition } from 'react';

// Urgent: Show what was typed
setInputValue(input);

// Mark any state updates inside as transitions
startTransition(() => {
  // Transition: Show the results
  setSearchQuery(input);
});
```


Updates wrapped in startTransition are handled as non-urgent and will be interrupted if more urgent updates like clicks or key presses come in. If a transition gets interrupted by the user (for example, by typing multiple characters in a row), React will throw out the stale rendering work that wasn’t finished and render only the latest update.


* `useTransition`: a Hook to start transitions, including a value to track the pending state.
* `startTransition`: a method to start transitions when the Hook cannot be used.

Transitions will opt in to concurrent rendering, which allows the update to be interrupted. If the content re-suspends, transitions also tell React to continue showing the current content while rendering the transition content in the background (see the [Suspense RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md) for more info).

[See docs for transitions here](/reference/react/useTransition).

### New Suspense Features {/*new-suspense-features*/}

Suspense lets you declaratively specify the loading state for a part of the component tree if it's not yet ready to be displayed:

```js
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Comments />
</Suspense>
```

Suspense makes the "UI loading state" a first-class declarative concept in the React programming model. This lets us build higher-level features on top of it.

We introduced a limited version of Suspense several years ago. However, the only supported use case was code splitting with React.lazy, and it wasn't supported at all when rendering on the server.

In React 18, we've added support for Suspense on the server and expanded its capabilities using concurrent rendering features.

Suspense in React 18 works best when combined with the transition API. If you suspend during a transition, React will prevent already-visible content from being replaced by a fallback. Instead, React will delay the render until enough data has loaded to prevent a bad loading state.

For more, see the RFC for [Suspense in React 18](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md).

### New Client and Server Rendering APIs {/*new-client-and-server-rendering-apis*/}

In this release we took the opportunity to redesign the APIs we expose for rendering on the client and server. These changes allow users to continue using the old APIs in React 17 mode while they upgrade to the new APIs in React 18.

#### React DOM Client {/*react-dom-client*/}

These new APIs are now exported from `react-dom/client`:

* `createRoot`: New method to create a root to `render` or `unmount`. Use it instead of `ReactDOM.render`. New features in React 18 don't work without it.
* `hydrateRoot`: New method to hydrate a server rendered application. Use it instead of  `ReactDOM.hydrate` in conjunction with the new React DOM Server APIs. New features in React 18 don't work without it.

Both `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` accept a new option called `onRecoverableError` in case you want to be notified when React recovers from errors during rendering or hydration for logging. By default, React will use [`reportError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/reportError), or `console.error` in the older browsers.

[See docs for React DOM Client here](/reference/react-dom/client).

#### React DOM Server {/*react-dom-server*/}

These new APIs are now exported from `react-dom/server` and have full support for streaming Suspense on the server:

* `renderToPipeableStream`: for streaming in Node environments.
* `renderToReadableStream`: for modern edge runtime environments, such as Deno and Cloudflare workers.

The existing `renderToString` method keeps working but is discouraged.

[See docs for React DOM Server here](/reference/react-dom/server).

### New Strict Mode Behaviors {/*new-strict-mode-behaviors*/}

In the future, we’d like to add a feature that allows React to add and remove sections of the UI while preserving state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.

This feature will give React apps better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.

To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.

Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:

```
* React mounts the component.
  * Layout effects are created.
  * Effects are created.
```


With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:

```
* React mounts the component.
  * Layout effects are created.
  * Effects are created.
* React simulates unmounting the component.
  * Layout effects are destroyed.
  * Effects are destroyed.
* React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.
  * Layout effects are created.
  * Effects are created.
```

[See docs for ensuring reusable state here](/reference/react/StrictMode#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-effects-in-development).

### New Hooks {/*new-hooks*/}

#### useId {/*useid*/}

`useId` is a new Hook for generating unique IDs on both the client and server, while avoiding hydration mismatches. It is primarily useful for component libraries integrating with accessibility APIs that require unique IDs. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but it's even more important in React 18 because of how the new streaming server renderer delivers HTML out-of-order. [See docs here](/reference/react/useId).

> Note
>
> `useId` is **not** for generating [keys in a list](/learn/rendering-lists#where-to-get-your-key). Keys should be generated from your data.

#### useTransition {/*usetransition*/}

`useTransition` and `startTransition` let you mark some state updates as not urgent. Other state updates are considered urgent by default. React will allow urgent state updates (for example, updating a text input) to interrupt non-urgent state updates (for example, rendering a list of search results). [See docs here](/reference/react/useTransition).

#### useDeferredValue {/*usedeferredvalue*/}

`useDeferredValue` lets you defer re-rendering a non-urgent part of the tree. It is similar to debouncing, but has a few advantages compared to it. There is no fixed time delay, so React will attempt the deferred render right after the first render is reflected on the screen. The deferred render is interruptible and doesn't block user input. [See docs here](/reference/react/useDeferredValue).

#### useSyncExternalStore {/*usesyncexternalstore*/}

`useSyncExternalStore` is a new Hook that allows external stores to support concurrent reads by forcing updates to the store to be synchronous. It removes the need for useEffect when implementing subscriptions to external data sources, and is recommended for any library that integrates with state external to React. [See docs here](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore).

> Note
>
> `useSyncExternalStore` is intended to be used by libraries, not application code.

#### useInsertionEffect {/*useinsertioneffect*/}

`useInsertionEffect` is a new Hook that allows CSS-in-JS libraries to address performance issues of injecting styles in render. Unless you’ve already built a CSS-in-JS library we don’t expect you to ever use this. This Hook will run after the DOM is mutated, but before layout effects read the new layout. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but is even more important in React 18 because React yields to the browser during concurrent rendering, giving it a chance to recalculate layout. [See docs here](/reference/react/useInsertionEffect).

> Note
>
> `useInsertionEffect` is intended to be used by libraries, not application code.
